# 🏈 NFL Locked In

NFL Locked In is a web application that combines the fun of NFL pick’em with a scoring system that rewards smart, unique choices. It’s designed for groups of friends who want more strategy than just “pick the obvious winner.”  

Built with **React**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, and powered by **Supabase** for authentication and data persistence, NFL Locked In is fast, modern, and built to scale.

##  What is NFL Locked In?

NFL Locked In is a project built by myself, James McGillicuddy, to better suit an NFL challenge a 
few friends have done for the past couple seasons. The gist of the challenge is that 
each week of the NFL regular season (Weeks 1–18), you pick **one team** you think will win.  
The catch? You can only pick each team **once** all season.  

The challenge is balancing “safe” picks with the risk of saving strong teams for later in the season, all while competing against your friends.

##  How Scoring Works

Scoring isn’t just win or lose, it also depends on how popular your pick was within your group:

- If you’re the **only one** who picked a winning team, you earn the **maximum points**.  
- If multiple people pick the same team, the points are split down to encourage unique strategies.  
- Once a team is used, it’s **locked out** for you the rest of the season.  

This creates a strategic tension:  
Do you pick the clear favorite, knowing others might too? Or take a risk on an underdog for a chance at big points?

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) with functional components and hooks.  
- **Styling**: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for clean, responsive, glassmorphism-inspired design.  
- **Backend**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication, database, and real-time group updates.  
- **UI Components**: [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) and [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) for accessible and interactive components.  

This stack keeps the project lightweight, maintainable, and easy to extend with new features (like playoffs support, custom scoring rules, or larger group sizes).
